I read some papers on how to set up a BSDE for American options,
in general American options can be formulated as reflected BSDEs
see Financial Mathematics Bressanone, 1996 Editor: W. J. Runggaldier.

Apparently for specific pay off functions it is possible to find
the K term without any numerical scheme see

The Early Exercise Premium Representation for American Options on Multiply Assets
http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00245-015-9293-5 .

In the 1 dimensional case this gets formulated in:
Valuing American options by simulation: a BSDEs approach.

My writing down a full derivation is probably not happening.

What I should do next probably is getting a deep bsde solver
working.

Here are some links I should look at:
